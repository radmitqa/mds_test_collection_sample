Sample on selecting scenarios to run

Optional: Just a sample suggestion based on our conversation how to handle Test Suite with a vast number of scenarios to run. 
Pls check collections.py file and execute it from PyCharm console by running the following:

1. python collections.py[Enter]
2. Prompt appears with options: select 1 to run all scenarios on Test Suite or select 2 to run specific scenarios
3. If 2 is selected there is the list with test cases displayed
4. If you add only 4[Enter] - only test_case_4 will run
5. If a list is added such as 1,3,5[Enter] - Only 1,3 and 5 will be executed
